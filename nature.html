                   Go on 9 &#215; 9 board and 19 &#215; 19 board are similar, as they share the same rules. But the game strategy and tactics are somewhat different. <mark class='pink'>Some teaching on the full-sized board may not well apply to 9 &#215; 9 Go</mark>. For example, the usual procedure of <em><a>starting in the corners, extending along the sides, then moving out into the center</em> is not a good strategy at all</a>. In 9 &#215; 9 Go, the promising areas are not classed as corners, sides, center. They are classed as the fifth, the fourth, the third, the second, and the first lines. <mark class='green'>The best opening strategy is to start on the fourth or the fifth lines, extend on the third line, then move out onto the second line before the first line</mark>. The middle game starts once one player makes a move on the second line for the first time. The endgame begins when one player makes a move on the first line for the first time.

<p>
Although Go and 9 &#215 9 Go share the same rules, the difference in board sizes causes the different terrain, which in turn causes the different game paradigms. As a result, the best 19 &#215 19 Go player are basically not the best 9 &#215 9 Go player unless he or she understands 9 &#215; 9 Go too. Likewise, AlphaGo Zero may not play 9 &#215 9 Go better than KataGo unless the first had been well trained to play Go on the 9-lines board.
</p>

<p>
To play 9 &#215; 9 Go better, ones must understand the nature of the game due to this board size. In Go, the best first move is on Hoshi (4-4). In 9 &#215; 9 Go, it is on Tengen (5-5), particularly in a high komi game (komi > 7 points).
	
</p>

<p>
Game results in 9 &#215 9 Go is more predictable. An opening with a single bad move can guarantee failure in a superhuman game. Moreover, game strategy must be modified at every move; adaptation is strategically crucial in 9 &#215; 9 Go, where the space and time are tiny; cause and effect are not spatially or temporally distancing.

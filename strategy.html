                <p>
                   The first strategy to get stronger at 9 &#215; 9 Go</a> is to get back to the basic: <mark class='green'>Understand the game objectives</mark>. 
</p>
<p>

Beginners play a lot of bad moves, as they want to capture. Then, they learn to be a territorial player, trying<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)'> to surround a larger total area of the board than the opponent</a>. They are advised by introductory Go books that such thing is the object of Go. They play the game better, but almost always fail to beat strong players. They do not understand the objectives of Go. The so-called "<em>objective</em>", in orthodox learning materials, is NOT the sole object of the game.
</p> 

<p>
In fact, the <mark>objective<a>s</a> of 9 &#215 9 Go </mark>are multiple:
<ul>
<li>To surround larger territory</li>
<li>To reduce the enemy's territory</li>
<li>To survive</li>
<li>To kill, preferrably not foreseen by the enemy</li>
</ul> 
<br>
<p>
<mark class='green'>All moves should be made efficiently, without needless moves</mark>. The ultimate goal is to gain victory at the end: To have a positive final score:
</p><br>

<p>
<em>B<sub>s</sub></em> = <em>B<sub>t</sub></em> + <em>B<sub>p</sub></em> + <em>B</em> - <em>W<sub>t</sub></em> - <em>W<sub>p</sub></em> - <em>W</em> - <em>k</em>
</p>

<p><br>
Where, <em>B<sub>s</sub></em> the net score for Black after the last move; <em>B<sub>t</sub></em> is Black's territory; <em>B<sub>p</sub></em> is white prisoner stones, <em>B</em> is black living stones on the board; <em>W<sub>t</sub></em> is White's territory; <em>W<sub>p</sub></em> is black prisoner stones; <em>W</em> is white living stones on the board;  <em>k</em> is WGA's standard komi (7 points). 
<br>
<p>
Any moves has an impact on the final score, and has some effects that are not intended, and often not even foreseen. You can control the game if you know what will be the consequence of each move and it turns out to be as intended.
</p>
<p>
That is possible if you know the true meaning behind each move, both yours and the opponents. A classic approach is to review quality games&mdash;the games played by top 9 dan professional players.
</p>

<p>
The better, modern approach is to review the superhuman games, in which you can see how and why the top superhuman AI makes each move like that in actual superhuman-vs-human games. For example,

<br>
<strong>Problem 1.</strong> Why is <span class='b'>1</span> on Tengen the best first move?

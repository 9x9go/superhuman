                <p>
                   We meant this book as a means of boosthing your 9 &#215; 9 Go skill, a superhuman AI game review, showing the true meaning behind each move in the actual superhuman vs human 9 &#215; 9 Go games. Attention will be paid to 9 &#215; 9 Go principles, in a form suitable for novices who are already know Go rules and curious to know how super strong players think.

<p>
Top professional Go players and superhuman players alike used to play a lot. The proverbs say, <em>"Lost your first 50 games as quickly as possible"</em> and <em>"A minute to learn, a lifetime to master."</em>. We did. The principal author reached 2 dan within the first 10,000 games; the best practice at the time is noted in <em>The Art of 9 &#215; 9 Go: How to Beat Dan Players at GoQuest</em>, which came out in 2009, when Go bots were still weaker than 9 dan professional Go players.</p>

<p>
Then, once David J. Wu had written a great open-source AlphaZero-like Go playing program named KataGo, there was a KataGo engine verified by GoQuest user <a>KataTest 9 dan</a> (20b9_335 on RTX2060), the first and only <a>invincible</a> No. 1 top ranked player on the server (92 win 0 lost 1 draw). The KataTest's game records are no longer publicly available from the server, but 39 of them have been compiled and published in <em>The Art of &#215 9 Go, Machine Learning Edition</em>. At the time, one of the best ways of fast learning was by studying quality games the greatest players have played.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays, we can better study 9 &#215; 9 Go with iOS application named <em></em><a>"A Master of Go"</a></em>, of which the version with an old KataGo engine and a weaker neural network run on mobile device could reach <a>No. 1 top ranked player on GoQuest</a> on August 11, 2020. With this app, we could correctly predict all the next moves of KataTest in our experiment, and know how it thinks.
</p>

<p>
Principles of 9 &#215; 9 Go noted in this book were learned from game analysis by A Master of Go, whose performance is arguably far beyond 9p or top superhuman of 9 &#215; 9 Go.

                    <li>
                        Basic movement: <em>Attack (away, approach, and attach) and defend (joint, jump, and jerk)</em>.
                    </li>

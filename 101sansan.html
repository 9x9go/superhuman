                   The novice, learning from several defeats, tend to play with <s>extra-</s><sup>too much</sup>caution. They fear failure and limit aggressive moves. At the opening, they prefer secure start in the corners, particularly at the 3-3 points. They want to prevent their stones, including <span class='b'>1</span>, from getting killed by White, which is a wrong strategy.

<p>
<mark>San-san</mark> (or the 3-3 point) is a typical opening on a 9 &#215; 9 board among beginners. However, <mark class='green'>superhuman AIs and top professionals alike do not make san-san opening</mark>. A Master of Go plays san-san opening only in zero-komi game, when Black is leading since the outset of the game and there is no need of aggressive moves in the opening.
